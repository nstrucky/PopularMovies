This app queries a RESTful API to retrieve movie titles, descriptions, videos and other media from themoviedb.org. 

## Project Build Notes

Make sure to include a gradle.properties file in the root director of the project which includes the API key for a TMDB account. 

```
TMDB_API_KEY="yourKeyGoesHere"
```
Then build the project and deploy - the app will then be able to access the TMDB API.
